An ordered blogroll widget for your sidebar that displays your favorite blogs, what they're writing, and when.

== Description ==

Google's Blogger tool has a great blogroll gadget, which I've always wanted in WordPress. I tried a few plugins that advertised similar behavior but was never quite satisfied - so I made my own.

This will grab all your links with a category of 'sidebar' and show them in a list on your sidebar. Specify each link's RSS/Atom feed address and it will grab the latest post, a link, and reorder the list based on when these posts were written. It only required that you have jQuery and PHP and uses the Links and Widget section already included in WordPress.

In the future, I'll be adding more options in the widgets' option screen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'good-reads.php' to the 'wp-content/plugins' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to 'Widgets' screen in 'Appearance'.
1. Drag 'Good Reads' into your Sidebar.
1. In the Widget settings, give it a title!
