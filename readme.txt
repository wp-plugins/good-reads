Good Reads readme:

Thanks for trying my plugin! Good Reads is a plugin that aims to duplicate Blogger's gadget 'My Blog List' which creates a Blogroll of your favorite links showing the site's title & link, the title & link of the latest post, and the time since it was published. While it may not have the all the features of Blogger's gadget, this plugin/widget does try to emulate its behavior. This is my first plugin so let me know what you think!

REQUIREMENTS:
1) jQuery

INSTALLATION:
1) Activate plugin.
2) Go to Widgets screen in Appearance.
3) Drag 'Good Reads' into your Sidebar.
4) In the Widget settings, give it a title!

SETUP:
1) Go to Link Categories in Links.
2) Create a new category called 'Sidebar'.
3) IMPORTANT: Any link that you want listed in your 'Good Reads' module will need to have the 'RSS Address' field (under Advanced in the Edit Link page) filled with the site's feed URL, so go put those in.
4) Apply the 'Sidebar' category to any link in your Links that you want listed in 'Good Reads'

That should be it. If you experience a problem make sure that you have the RSS Address field filled (correctly) and the Sidebar category applied to the Link. Problems after that may apply to that site's feed having errors in it, which can happen.
