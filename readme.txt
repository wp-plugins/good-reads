An ordered blogroll widget for your sidebar that displays your favorite blogs, what they're writing, and when.

== Description ==

Google's Blogger tool has a great blogroll gadget, which I've always wanted in WordPress. I tried a few plugins that advertised similar behavior but was never quite satisfied - so I made my own.

This will grab all your links with a category of 'sidebar' and show them in a list on your sidebar. Specify each link's RSS/Atom feed address and it will grab the latest post, a link, and reorder the list based on when these posts were written. It only requires that you have jQuery and PHP and uses the Links and Widget section already included in WordPress.

In the future, I'll be adding more options in the widget's option screen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'good-reads.php' to the 'wp-content/plugins' directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the 'Widgets' screen in 'Appearance' and add 'Good Reads' to your Sidebar.
1. Go to your WordPress' 'Links' and create a category called 'Sidebar'.
1. Add this category and the feed URL (in the RSS Address field) to each link you want to appear in 'Good Reads'.

== Screenshots ==

1. A 'Good Reads' module in my sidebar with four sites in the 'sidebar' category.
